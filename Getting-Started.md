We'll be using Java to program our robot, but before you can start writing code you'll need to get through some initial setup. Read through the information below to get started!

## GitHub

GitHub is a website for storing and sharing software source code. You're on GitHub right now!

[Create an account](https://github.com/join) by choosing an appropriate username and clicking _Create an account_. Message [emddudley](https://github.com/emddudley) with your GitHub username and he will add you to the [Arctic Warriors](https://github.com/ArcticWarriors) organization on GitHub.

## SourceTree

[SourceTree](http://www.sourcetreeapp.com/) is a free application that makes it easy to upload and download code to and from our GitHub repository.

Download and install SourceTree. You can accept all the default installation options.

When you launch SourceTree for the first time it will ask you whether you want to _Install global ignore file?_ Click Yes. Then select GitHub from the _Add an account_ dialog and enter your GitHub username and password.

If you've been added to the Arctic Warriors organization, you can select the _snobot2015_ repository on the _Clone your first repo_ dialog. Otherwise, click the _Skip Setup_ button. If you are asked about an SSH Key click No.
